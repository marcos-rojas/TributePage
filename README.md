A single tribute page about Marcus Aurelius: This was made as part of Responsive Web Design Certificate from FreeCodeCamp

I've chosen the roman emperor because I really like what he wrote in *meditations* :book:. Some lections I've got are:
- Be grateful to everyone and take their actions as lections for you
- Never be cautious when spend time or money in education
- Our purpose is to help the community
